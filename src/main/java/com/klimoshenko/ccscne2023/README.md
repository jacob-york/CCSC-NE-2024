## Problem notes

### Problem 1

- Simple array problem
- Reminds me of some of the greedy algorithm problems I did on LeetCode, so it might be considered a greedy algorithm

### Problem 2

- Easily implemented using functional style, but might be harder/pretty verbose otherwise
- Key is non-obvious mathematical formula (whether two circles intersect)

### Problem 3

- Multiple steps
- Graph problem
    - Matrix problems are very often graph problems
- Requires graph traversal (DFS or BFS) to spread ocean cells

### Problem 4

- My output doesn't match
- Developing my own algorithm was straightforward, but I spent a lot of time trying to match their exact output and I
  still don't see how they calculated it

### Problem 5

- Remembering how to do permutations was the hardest part for me
    - I used a simple recursive backtracking solution
- Permutations (or any backtracking) implementation is pretty verbose in Java ðŸ˜¢
- Another W for functional programming

### Problem 6

- Simple ideas but pretty intricate code
- Instructions are a little unclear
    - It took me a while to figure out what `row` and `column` in the 4-tuple were doing
- It took me longer to draw a diamond than the rest of the code ðŸ¤¦
- Provided output doesn't actually match the given test case
    - Second test case's `numRows` is 20 but only 18 are drawn
    - Second test case's offset is wrong
